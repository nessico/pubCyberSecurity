The goal of this assignment is to replicate the original C program by static analyzing the disassembly of the binary file, then copy stop by stop of how the program is made.

Here are some hints:
1. You can determine some of the functions used by looking at the blue text (default) in graph mode.
2. In graph mode, when an arrow keeps going back and forth between boxes, you can assume it's a loop.
3. Use the spacebar to switch between graph mode and text mode, you can do this even during debugging.
